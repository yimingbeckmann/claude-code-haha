  return `Reads a file from the local filesystem on the Mac. Use this for any file the user wants you to look at: config files (.conf, .toml, .yaml, .ini), plist XML, shell scripts (.sh, .zshrc, .bash_profile), logs, markdown notes, CSV/JSON data files, .env files, plain text documents, screenshots, receipts, and PDFs.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to ${MAX_LINES_TO_READ} lines starting from the beginning of the file${maxSizeInstruction}
${offsetInstruction}
${lineFormat}
- This tool allows MacHelper to read images (eg PNG, JPG screenshots or photos). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as MacHelper is a multimodal LLM.${

      ? '\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf) such as receipts, invoices, manuals, and documents. For large PDFs (more than 10 pages), you MUST provide the pages parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g., pages: "1-5"). Reading a large PDF without the pages parameter will fail. Maximum 20 pages per request.'

- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining text, data, and visualizations.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To list the contents of a directory, use an ls command via the ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} tool.
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.
- For Mac-system file paths that this tool cannot access directly (sandboxed locations, files requiring elevated permissions, or files managed by MacMind), prefer MacMind's \`fs.read\` action as an alternative.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.`
